     politically and militarily with Vietnam that led to the war.
      The four major causes of the war were the politics from the Cold War,
       The Gulf of Tonkin, the power struggles between France and the Ho Chi Minh, 
       and The Domino Theory. Due to the administration of John F. Kennedy, the President at the time,
        the United States involvement became more and more drastic as troops were forced to participate in
         battle and acquire supplies and weaponry.`

    media coverage would display false news and would affect public perspective on the ideas and realities 
    of the war. Each country believed theirs was doing the right thing and followed what the media displayed 
    to the public. In addition, some citizens began to feel betrayed by their nations due to the negative sources 
    they would receive and lies from the government. While there was a variety of negative public opinions, the 
    horrors and devastation soldiers would face while in battle caught the attention of American citizens and they 
    would come together in order to support their troops and provide them with any care they needed.
