    text1.innerHTML = `<b>Causes of the war:</b>The United States had major conflicts
     politically and militarily with Vietnam that led to the war.
      The four major causes of the war were the politics from the Cold War,
       The Gulf of Tonkin, the power struggles between France and the Ho Chi Minh, 
       and The Domino Theory. Due to the administration of John F. Kennedy, the President at the time,
        the United States involvement became more and more drastic as troops were forced to participate in
         battle and acquire supplies and weaponry.`
    text2.innerHTML = `<b>Major Battles and Turning Points: </b>There were 11 major battles that took place during the Vietnam War that left 
    an impact on the United States and involvement of their troops. These battles are Battle of Dien Bien Phu,
     the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, the Battle of Ia Drang Valley, the Battle of Khe Sanh, the Tet Offensive, 
     the Battle of Hue, the Cambodia Incursion, the Lam Son 719, the Easter Offensive, the Linebacker Operations,
     and the Fall of Saigon. Each one of these battles put the lives of American troops on the line, leading to a 
     very high number of casualties. In addition, the troops were fighting in unfamiliar locations and caused a 
     copious amount of destruction.
     <br><br><br>
     <b>The Role of International Players: </b> There were a number of nations that provided military and economic 
     assistance to Vietnam and the United States during the war. The Soviet Union and China provided allegiance to 
     North Vietnam while the United States supported South Vietnam. Aside from the conflict surrounding the war, 
     average citizens of these nations formed their own groups to support their beliefs and opinions along with their 
     neighbors.`

    text1.innerHTML = `<b>Guerrilla warfare tactics:</b>The Guerrilla warfare tactics were implemented in order to 
    overthrow a political system through the use of war, violence, and terrorism. In addition, these smaller forces 
    would battle against much larger forces and would strike early before the opponents would appear. The methods used 
    in order to complete these attacks also included non-combat bombings, weapon attacks, hit and runs, 
    and massive strikes.`
    text2.innerHTML = `<b>The use of chemical weapons like Agent Orange: </b>Aside from bombing and killing humans, the chemical, Agent Orange, was used in order
    to destroy plants, shrubs, and trees. By doing so, the enemy was unable to eat these crops or harvest any food.
     The toxics coming from these plants were proven lethal to the army and was another strain keeping them from survival.

     <b>The Domino Theory and Containment Policy</b>The Domino Theory stated that if one country or nation is failing or falling apart, 
     then all surrounding countries would meet the same fate. This idea applied specifically to communism 
     because Northern Vietnam followed communist ideals during the war. On the other hand, the Containment 
     Policy stated that the United States would do everything they could to prevent the spread of communism. `

    text1.innerHTML = `<b>Home Front and Public Opinion:</b> Due to the massive spread of propaganda, 
    media coverage would display false news and would affect public perspective on the ideas and realities 
    of the war. Each country believed theirs was doing the right thing and followed what the media displayed 
    to the public. In addition, some citizens began to feel betrayed by their nations due to the negative sources 
    they would receive and lies from the government. While there was a variety of negative public opinions, the 
    horrors and devastation soldiers would face while in battle caught the attention of American citizens and they 
    would come together in order to support their troops and provide them with any care they needed.
    `
    text2.innerHTML = `<b>Media coverage and its impact on public perception : </b>The war draft became a very widely discussed topic during the Vietnam War. 
    The number of men who were pooled to be drafted reached about 2 million, the largest amount during
     the time and caused a wide deal of concern for Americans. While some believed it was unfair for 
     young men to risk their lives, others believed it was an honor to serve their country and protect 
     their home. At the time it was rare for any man to be excused from the draft and there were thousands 
     of casualties from each battle. While today the ability for a citizen to fight and serve their country 
     is optional, the bravery of the American soldiers during the Vietnam War was never forgotten and is still
      remembered to this day. The draft showed the strengths of each man who served and the irony of how the men 
      who were given no free will to choose to fight were fighting for their countries freedom. `

Due to the massive spread of propaganda, media coverage would display

    <b>Prominent figures in the anti-war movement:</b>The most well known prominent figure who spoke out about their thoughts on anti-war
     and the Vietnam war specifically was Martin Luther King Jr. He delivered a speech 
     called “Beyond Vietnam” that expressed how unjust the war was, sending out innocent people 
     to fight for their country when there was no way to know the outcome and if they would be making 
     a difference or remembered. MLK informed the world about how the war was not making any positive 
     changes for our society and only further influencing racial injustice and economic issues for the United States.

 <b>Artistic expressions of protest (music, literature, etc.) :</b>
 Art is the most visual and audible expression of human feelings of vulnerability and anguish during the war.
  Political cartoons, paintings, and songs were created in order to display the emotions of everyday citizens 
  and their point of view on what the war has done to society. A few well known depictions of art are the songs 
  “Give Peace a Chance” by John Lennon and the painting “the famous brothers in arms” by Dan Nance. Lennon’s song
   is famous amongst anti war activists and the painting clearly shows the suffering of soldiers and now the men 
   have each others backs.

    text1.innerHTML = `<b> The wars impact on Vietnam and neighboring countries:</b> The war greatly impacted Vietnam and its neighboring countries.
     All of the damage caused, costs of these damages, bombings, and naturally made toxics
      formed irreparable loss. For instance, the use of Agent Orange and extremely specific 
      bombings were incredibly elaborate while deadly. The number of deaths of not only civilians
       and soldiers caused citizens to flee their home country in order to protect their families 
       and escape persecution.`
       text2.innerHTML = `<b>The Paris Peace Accords and the fall of Saigon:</b>The Paris Peace Accords was an agreement formed between North Vietnam,
        South Vietnam, and the United States. The accords stated that the Vietnamese nations would 
        hold back from attacking and the United States would do the same thing and retreat back home.
         The Fall of Saigon occurred when North Vietnam captured Saigon and the south surrendered. Due 
         to the capture from the North, President Ford called for an immediate evacuation for the United 
         States troops back home.

         <b>Long-term effects on veterans and civilians: </b>
         The outcome and grueling time during the Vietnam War caused long term effects on veterans 
         and civilians that were both positive and negative. Veterans that fought in the war were honored 
         and respected for the rest of their lives for the support they provided to their nation. These 
         veterans continued to do volunteer work and provide small acts of service to the military. On the other hand,
          not many veterans were lucky to make it out of the war without any life altering injuries, or stay alive at all.
           Millions of families lost their loved ones and not only were there lots of physical injuries, 
           but a majority of troops experienced mental decline as well. This included post traumatic stress 
           disorder and depression.

    text1.innerHTML = `<b>The wars place in historical memory:</b>The war caused a dramatic change in American history and will always be remembered for 
    the number of battles and soldiers that gave their life to defend their country. Citizens began to lose faith
     in the government, develop their own organizations to protect the war, and build stronger relationships with 
     other nations while worsening them with others. Families strived to keep their loved ones safe and pray for
      their protection if they had any relatives fighting in the war. These battles also increased the purchase 
      of weapons in the military and usage of bombs and tools. Soldiers learned how to skillfully attack with 
      dangerous weapons. Lastly, the cost of the weapons, damages, and medical care caused by the war was 
      extremely overwhelming. Families were unable to pay for repairs and the government struggled to pay 
      to restore the land and civilian homes. 
    `
    text2.innerHTML = `<b>The evolution of military tactics and international relations 
     :</b>The evolution of military tactics and international relations greatly increased 
    in size and magnitude during the war. Soldiers became more creative and meticulous about their strategies
     for attack and weapons used to attack their enemies. Natural chemicals and weapons were not the only kind of 
     military tactics, as treaties were included as well. The Guilleira war tactics and treaties , such as the 
     Containment Policy, signed by Vietnamese and US governments were used to the advantage of their own troops
      and nations. International relations worsened for some and benefited other nations. South Vietnam had the
       protection of the Soviet aunuim due to their similar communist beliefs and the United States supported 
       themselves and continued to battle against Vietnam.
