     politically and militarily with Vietnam that led to the war.
      The four major causes of the war were the politics from the Cold War,
       The Gulf of Tonkin, the power struggles between France and the Ho Chi Minh, 
       and The Domino Theory. Due to the administration of John F. Kennedy, the President at the time,
        the United States involvement became more and more drastic as troops were forced to participate in
         battle and acquire supplies and weaponry.`
    text2.innerHTML = `<b>Major Battles and Turning Points: </b>There were 11 major battles that took place during the Vietnam War that left 
    an impact on the United States and involvement of their troops. These battles are Battle of Dien Bien Phu,
     the Gulf of Tonkin Incident, the Battle of Ia Drang Valley, the Battle of Khe Sanh, the Tet Offensive, 
     the Battle of Hue, the Cambodia Incursion, the Lam Son 719, the Easter Offensive, the Linebacker Operations,
     and the Fall of Saigon. Each one of these battles put the lives of American troops on the line, leading to a 
     very high number of casualties. In addition, the troops were fighting in unfamiliar locations and caused a 
     copious amount of destruction.
     <br><br><br>
     <b>The Role of International Players: </b> There were a number of nations that provided military and economic 
     assistance to Vietnam and the United States during the war. The Soviet Union and China provided allegiance to 
     North Vietnam while the United States supported South Vietnam. Aside from the conflict surrounding the war, 
     average citizens of these nations formed their own groups to support their beliefs and opinions along with their 
     neighbors.`

    overthrow a political system through the use of war, violence, and terrorism. In addition, these smaller forces 
    would battle against much larger forces and would strike early before the opponents would appear. The methods used 
    in order to complete these attacks also included non-combat bombings, weapon attacks, hit and runs, 
    and massive strikes.`

    to the public. In addition, some citizens began to feel betrayed by their nations due to the negative sources 
    they would receive and lies from the government. While there was a variety of negative public opinions, the 
    horrors and devastation soldiers would face while in battle caught the attention of American citizens and they

      bombings were incredibly elaborate while deadly. The number of deaths of not only civilians

    text1.innerHTML = `<b>The wars place in historical memory:</b>The war caused a dramatic change in American history and will always be remembered for 
    the number of battles and soldiers that gave their life to defend their country. Citizens began to lose faith
     in the government, develop their own organizations to protect the war, and build stronger relationships with 
     other nations while worsening them with others. Families strived to keep their loved ones safe and pray for
      their protection if they had any relatives fighting in the war. These battles also increased the purchase 
      of weapons in the military and usage of bombs and tools. Soldiers learned how to skillfully attack with 
      dangerous weapons. Lastly, the cost of the weapons, damages, and medical care caused by the war was 
      extremely overwhelming. Families were unable to pay for repairs and the government struggled to pay 
      to restore the land and civilian homes.
