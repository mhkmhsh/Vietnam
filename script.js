     politically and militarily with Vietnam that led to the war.
      The four major causes of the war were the politics from the Cold War,
       The Gulf of Tonkin, the power struggles between France and the Ho Chi Minh, 
       and The Domino Theory. Due to the administration of John F. Kennedy, the President at the time,
        the United States involvement became more and more drastic as troops were forced to participate in
         battle and acquire supplies and weaponry.`

    to the public. In addition, some citizens began to feel betrayed by their nations due to the negative sources 
    they would receive and lies from the government. While there was a variety of negative public opinions, the

      bombings were incredibly elaborate while deadly. The number of deaths of not only civilians

    the number of battles and soldiers that gave their life to defend their country. Citizens began to lose faith
     in the government, develop their own organizations to protect the war, and build stronger relationships with 
     other nations while worsening them with others. Families strived to keep their loved ones safe and pray for
      their protection if they had any relatives fighting in the war. These battles also increased the purchase 
      of weapons in the military and usage of bombs and tools. Soldiers learned how to skillfully attack with 
      dangerous weapons. Lastly, the cost of the weapons, damages, and medical care caused by the war was 
      extremely overwhelming. Families were unable to pay for repairs and the government struggled to pay 
      to restore the land and civilian homes.
